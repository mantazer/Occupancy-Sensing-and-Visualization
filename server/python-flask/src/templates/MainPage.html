                    I learned pretty early that the best way I learn is by doing, plain and simple. There is only so much I can learn from reading tutorials or sitting in the classroom; at some point I have to dive in and face things head on. This thought process has been the foundation for all of these projects. All of these projects were inspired by different instances, some as class projects, some while sitting with friends at Hackathons, and most just sitting by myself wondering what I'm doing with my life. Either way, I've ending up learning a lot from each one of these projects and have become a better programmer because of them. Check out <a href="http://github.com/vrk7bp"> my GitHub </a> to see my code or keep track of what I'm working on lately.

                                During large power outages, especially those caused by large storms, power suppliers waste lots of money and time trying to figure out what houses and neighborhoods have power and which don't. When Hurricane Sandy hit the New York/New Jersey area, it was estimated that power suppliers took thousands of trips out to the affected areas to simply figure out which houses had power and which ones didn't. This massive inefficiency was the inspiration for Project Pulsar. My partner <a href="http://github.com/mantazer" target="_newtab"> Muntaser</a> and I created a system that rests on the basic assumption that as long as a house has access to internet, that they have access to electricity. We used an Intel Galileo Embedded System to send http requests to a central Amazon EC2 server, with the idea that the embedded system represents the "sensor" in the house. With the server, we had a central database that kept track of the state of every embedded system on the network. When the server notices that one of the systems has been down longer than usual (meaning an http request hasn't been received  from the embedded system recently), we probe the Internet Service Provider (i.e. Comcast) via a Twilio Application in order to figure out if there is an Internet Outage on the side of the ISP as opposed to a power outage. Once this decision is made, and if it is determined that there is a Power Outage, the information is conveyed to the power distributor via a web client.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This project gained a lot of recognition at PennApps, especially by the hardware sponsors. Both Muntaser and I, as well as a couple of Electrical Engineering friends, hope to continue the project to see if we can truly find a way to determine power outages cheaply and efficiently. Although Project Pulsar as it stands may fit the basic mold, getting access to user's internet (with security and passwords) as well as configuring with the Internet Service Provider (so as to differentiate between a power outage and internet outage) has to be fleshed out more before this project can truly become scalable.

But I don't always go through all of the top articles of the day, and instead find myself picking articles that are more related to topics such as Cloud Computing and entrepreneurship. This was the inspiration for HackerFeed. Along with two of my friends, <a href="http://github.com/mantazer" target="_newtab"> Muntaser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/a-beck" target="_newtab"> Andrew</a>, we decided to create a Hacker News reader application that would take into account the articles that you have read in order to reorganize the typical ordered feed coming from Hacker News directly.

                                Inspired by the heroic 2014 NBA Finals win by the San Antonio Spurs. As a way to celebrate the win, and tease my Miami Heat friend, I decided to make an e-mail application that would send a different picture of Tim Duncan (as well as a random quote) to anyone who chose to sign up for the e-mail list. I used the <href a="https://developers.google.com/custom-search/" target="_newtab"> Custom Google Search API </href> and <href a="https://sendgrid.com/" target="_newtab"> SendGrid API </href>  to set this up, and am currently running on an AWS micro instance as a daily cronjob. For a period of time, I also set this application to run every hour in order to spam my Miami Heat fan with Tim Duncan photos. I regret nothing.

                                The code for this project is relatively simple (not more than 100 actual lines of code), and setting up a Cron Job on an AWS instance can be done in less than a minute.

                                I decided after the Fall 2014 semester to take on the project of building my own website. I had just gotten comfortable with the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_newtab"> Flask web server</a>, and had played around with various cloud services such as Amazon Web Services and Google App Engine. I figured that building my own personal website would be the perfect way to build on what I had picked up from the previous semester, and the perfect opportunity to learn HTML and CSS (which I had very minimal experience with prior). What I am most proud of about this website is that I started literally from nothing and built this website myself. I built the server using Flask, figured out how to run it on GAE (which was a total pain), learned the HTML and CSS, and created a beautiful website. For a more in-depth look into how this site was created and my process, check out my <a href="#AboutSitePage"> About This Site page</a>.

                                At some point soon, I hope to make a tutorial on the "programmer's guide to building a personal website". I will walk through building the Flask web server, putting it on App Engine, setting up a personal URL, and provide my HTML and CSS template for others to use. I figured it would be a fun little project that might help some people who are in the position I was in not too long ago.

                                PS: I apologize in advance for the insane amount of commits I made to this repository, and the horrific commit messages. I added Push-To-Deploy to my GAE application, therefore every push I made to GitHub updated my application in the backend. I picked up on the 'Inspect Element' tool on Chrome late in the process, so you will see a lot of very small, meager changes between commits.

                                The problem statement here was pretty simple. Using Python, we were tasked with creating our own rudimentary version of DropBox. The problem can be broken down into two separate sections, the client side which has to recognize file changes and "ping" the server accordingly and the server side which has to take into account these changes and update the other synchronized users accordingly. For the client side, we used the Python framework <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/watchdog" target="_newtab"> WatchDog</a> in order to monitor files. WatchDog is extremely easy to use, providing you the ability to trigger events based on the file activity that happened (for example, you can have a different event triggered if a file is created versus deleted). On the sever side, we built a <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_newtab"> Flask web server</a> (again, very easy to use) and utilized its file transfer libraries in order to retrieve the updated files. At a basic level, we had each triggered WatchDog event hit a different endpoint of the Flask webserver so that the server could act accordingly. We also had another thread working in the background monitoring the server in case changes happen on another client's end (so that all machines that are accessing the server are updated). The Flask server was run on an AWS micro-instance.

                                Although I worked in a group of three other students on this project, I can confidently  say that I did 95% of the coding for this project (as highlighted by <a href="https://github.com/vrk7bp/OneDir/graphs/contributors"> this graph</a>). Even though it wasn't the most ideal situation, especially during crunch time at the end of the semester, I really learned a lot from the project as a whole. From my experience building this OneDir system from back to front, I got comfortable picking up new libraries and frameworks that I knew nothing about and figuring out how to use them. I got really good with my debugging, google searching, and just general understanding of what to look for when figuring out new things.

                                MHacks was my second Hackathon, but the first one where I really had a grasp as to what I was doing as a programmer. I was lucky enough to fly up to Ann Arbor, Michigan with my great partner and good friend <a href="http://github.com/mantazer" target="_newtab"> Muntaser</a>, which helped make the experience a great one. Unfortunately we didn't have an idea going into the Hackathon, and failed to come up with something that we could both agree on for some time (we both don't consider ourselves to be the most creative). Eventually we were able to combine our love of sports with our passion for trash talking other people into a creative application that we built throughout the weekend.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                TrashTalk is an application that allows the user to navigate through their contacts and select the favorite NFL teams for each contact. Then, based upon the happenings on Sunday, the application will automatically send trash talk to your friends via text message. For example, let's say that my friend Bob was a Steelers fan. If the Steelers are playing the Ravens, and the Ravens score a touchdown, a text message will be sent from my phone with some randomly generated trash talk to Bob.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Unfortunately, we were unable to integrate the sports score API before we ran out of time. The application was 90% complete, with the UI to select teams in place and the text message generation working. We have yet to go back and integrate the sports API since we have moved on to working on other projects together. At some point we will come back and tie up all the loose ends on the app.

                            <p> Although I had learned JAVA in high school, and considered myself fairly competent with the language, I had never attempted any sort of mobile development before this class. Programming an Android application really pushes your program and JAVA skills to the test, and it was an experience I learned a lot from. Dealing with obstacles such as coordinating with the Google Maps API, understanding the intricacies of Android, and navigating through weird error messages really helped me gain a better appreciation of what it takes to be a great programmer and how important it is to stay organized as a programmer. </p>

                            <p> I worked on this application with three other students (randomly assigned) as our final project for the class. Just like with the Geography Toy mentioned below, I had not learned about the magic of GitHub yet and therefore did not make use of it. Therefore this repository has a very minimal amount of commits. As a side note, I highly recommend learning GitHub to anyone who is working on a group coding project. It makes your life so much easier. </p>

                            <p> My first real, overwhelming introduction to engineering and college came in the form of my first engineering class, ENGR 1620 (Introduction to Engineering). For the final project of the semester, me and a group of four other students were tasked with making a physical, educational toy for elementary aged students. As easy as this sounded, the overall scope of the project became apparent very quickly. Coordinating the programming of the toy with the physical aspect, while also making sure to fulfill the proper standards of learning in Virginia and including feedback from multiple sources, was extremely challenging. Although it there were some of bumps in the road and a lot of sleepless nights, I learned a lot from the project in the end. </p>

                            <p> On the programming end, the entire project was built in JAVA. Our toy was a Geography Toy that asked questions related to continents for students to answer. The students could physically select a continent by moving an arrow over what they believed the answer was (we coordinated with RFID tags in order to realize which continent was which). A GUI with a picture of the World Map, the question, and a students points was shown on a computer screen. As the student answered questions, the questions generated would be adjusted based on the percieved level of the student. </p>

                            <p> Unfortunately, I did not know the magic of GitHub or the importance of neat code at this point in my coding career. The code is really hard to follow and is very honed into the problem that we had.

                    Since my senior year in high school, I have found an interest in doing research. Although the research that I've been able to get published has not been in my direct fields of study, they have been in areas that I am really interested in outside of school. Each one of my publications have been in a different field: environmental sciences, government policy analysis, and engineering education.

                        <h3> Fall 2014 [Fourth Year of College] </h3>
                        As part of the Engineering Student Council at UVa, I run the Student Taught Classes program for the Engineering School. This wildely successful program was founded in the Spring of 2013 with an <a href="http://shuklan.com/haskell/" target="_newtab">Introduction to Haskell </a> class. With an enrollment of more than 50 students on campus, and over 1,000 unique visitors online, we knew that we had something special. After getting approval from the Dean of the Engineering School, we moved forward with a completely student-run Student Taught Classes program. More than a year later, we have offered seven classes through the program ranging in topics from Auto-Mechanics to Data Visualization. These classes are offered as one-credit pass/fail courses that don't fulfill any degree requirement. The sole purpose of the courses are to provide students with industry knowledge or techinical skills that aren't otherwise covered in the engineering curriculum. This program has garnered a lot of <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/programming-languages-auto-mechanics-engineering-students-give-teaching-try" target="_newtab"> local media attention </a> and praise from professors and administrators around the school. My co-chair, Anish Simhal, and I teamed up with our dean and a professor to write a paper on the use of Student Taught Classes in the engineering curriculum. We were lucky enough to get this paper approved for the <a href="http://fie2014.org/" target="_newtab"> IEEE Frontiers in Education 2014 conference</a>!

                        During my internship with NASA in the summer of 2013, I worked in the Commercial Spaceflight Development Division. My main task during the summer was to research past partnerships that NASA had with private space companies in order to better quantify what factors differentiated successful partnerships from failures. My research for this assignment focused on reading through a number of GAO reports and going through more than a dozen interviews with the heads of the Human Exploration and Operations Directorate within NASA. This research culminated in this research paper, which was circulated through NASA (all the way to the NASA Administrator's office) and published in the Virginia Engineering and Science Research Journal.

                        As my Independent Science Research project for my senior year of high school, I decided to work on a project that combined Behavioral Science with Environmental Science. I wanted to see if changes in Ultraviolet Radiation over time had any concurrent effects on population shifts. This was mostly a data analysis project that consisted of analyzing a combination of <a href="http://www.census.gov/main/www/access.html" target="_newtab"> US Census data </a> and <a href="http://uvb.nrel.colostate.edu/UVB/index.jsf" target="_newtab"> UV Radiation data</a>. I also played around with some ArcGIS software to better visualize the data across the country. This was my first real in-depth research paper, and I was able to win enough prize money to pay for my college laptop from all the fairs and competitions I entered the project in.

                    So you want to learn more about me, huh? Who can blame you, I'm a pretty interesting person. As you have probably figured out by now, I am a 4th Year student at the University of Virginia studying Computer Engineering and Economics (with an Engineering Business Minor). I am a pretty big sports fan, and love supporting the Virginia Cavaliers in every sport we play. I'm especially passionate about our basketball team, and dream about the day we win a National Championship.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    From a programming standpoint, I am really interested in Cloud Computing and have recently dived into learning about Machine Learning. Although building this website has been a worthwhile project, and I've learned a lot from it, I definitely lean more toward back-end development as opposed to front-end. My passion and pursuit to become a great programmer really started less than a year ago, in the second semester of my third year, and since then I have been coding and learning non-stop. Some of my bigger coding projects have been <a href="http://github.com/vrk7bp/OneDir"> creating a more rudimentary version of DropBox </a>, <a href="https://github.com/vrk7bp/UVAGuidedTourApplication"> an Android Application for a self-guided tour through UVa </a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/vrk7bp/GeographyToyCode"> geography toy that integrated RFID and push-button sensors along with a GUI and question generator </a> (what I consider my first major coding project ever, from my first semester first year).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having finished my third year of college, I have really gotten a chance to see what the fields of Computer Engineering and Economics have to offer and figure out where my interests lie. Among my favorite classes in CpE have been my Computer Architecture and Design class (where we learned about, analyzed, and built in VHDL, processors, memory components, and other hardware components in computers), my Cloud Computing class (where we learned about the technologies behind and uses of Cloud Computing, as well as use the various Cloud providers such as AWS and GAE during assignments), and Bioelectricity (where we analyzed various physiological phenomenon, such as Action Potentials, from an electrical circuit point of view). On the Economics side, I'm really interested in Experimental Economics, particularly because of its strong connection with Computer Science. Since so many of these economic experiments can be administered via computers, and since so much more data can be retrieved and analyzed by computers, Experimental Economics is the unison of both the Computer Science and Economics fields.

                    Outside of class, I enjoy playing basketball with friends and try to give back to the Engineering School (or E-School as we lovingly call it at UVa) as much as I can. Since my first year at UVa I have been a board member for the Engineering Student Council, an elected position that comes with a lot of responsibility. I'm also a TA for CS 2110 (Software Development Methods), an Engineering School Tour Guide, and one of the founding students (and lead organizers) of <a href="http://hackuva.io/" target="_newtab"> Hack.UVa </a>. I'm also the head of the Student Taught Courses program within the Engineering School. This program has gained a lot of publicity around the campus and within local media <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/programming-languages-auto-mechanics-engineering-students-give-teaching-try" target="_newtab"> (UVa Today) </a>. Overall my college career has been a wild ride, and I'm glad to say that it still isn't finished.

                    If you haven't seen it already, the code for this site can be found <a href="http://www.github.com/vrk7bp/gautamwebsite"> here</a>. This site is built using a Python Framework called <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_newtab"> Flask</a>. For anyone wanting to build their own site from scratch, I highly recommend using Flask. It is extremely easy to use and very intuitive. From a server standpoint, this site is running on Google App Engine. Although the App Engine documentation makes it sound like it is very easy to run a Flask webserver on their machines, I did not find this to be the case. I spent many hours trying to figure out how to run Flask on Google's platform, and even considered jumping to Amazon Web Services a couple of times. One of the biggest problems is that unless the 3rd party application you want to use <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27" target="_newtab"> is on this list</a>, you have to physically download these files and put them in the right hierarchy among your other folders and files related to the project. This got especially annoying with Flask, because Flask is built on other un-supported 3rd party libraries such as werkzeug and jinja2. Eventually I was able to get the web server working, then it was a matter of figuring out the HTML and CSS. For those of you who aren't interested in learning how to use Flask with Google App Engine, or don't want to deal with a webserver at all, I recommend looking into <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_newtab"> GitHub Pages</a>. GitHub Pages is perfect for those people who are more worried about the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because it abstracts away the Web Server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based upon the troubles I had, and the amount of searching I had to do to find the right answers, I figured it would be worthwhile to create a step-by-step tutorial on how to build a Flask webserver on App Engine. Although there are ready-to-go GitHub repositories that you can simply fork and use, I did not find this as satisfying as figuring it out myself. There were a couple of solutions I happened on that turned out to be outdated, and it became hard trying to figure out what was old information from new. My goal will be to have step by step instructions, as well as explanations as to what you are doing, for building a Flask web server on Google App Engine. I will also throw in some explanations on how to get your own personal URL for the site (I used NameCheap), and how to link the code you deploy to App Engine to GitHub so you can push to both at the same time. This will all be under the pre-tense of building your own personal website. Stay tuned...
                </p>
                <p>
                    So why did I build this site? The more and more I have gotten into programming, the quicker I have realized that I learn by doing. There is only so much I can get out of reading a tutorial or typing some lines on Codecademy (not that I dislike Codecademy, I love the site and visit it often). At some point you just have to really dive in. This site was my version of diving into web development. I had learned about building a basic web server and the power of Flask before, but I had absolutely no knowledge of building websites and figured this would be the perfect opportunity to learn. Throw in the fact that I learned a bit about Google App Engine, and I would say that it was an overall great experience that was well worth while. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other reason I built this site is because every legitimate, boss programmer has his or her own website. And I was ready to become a boss programmer.
